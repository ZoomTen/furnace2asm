	<h1>Furnace2Asm<br><small>0.1</small></h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>What is it, really?</h2>
	<p>
		Eh, something to convert Furnace project
		files into assembly for use in
		<code>pokecrystal</code>, <code>pokegold</code>,
		maybe even <code>pokered</code> (option to compile <i>that</i> maybe coming soon) if you so wish.
		Nothing special, really. I had a command line
		tool but I decided to upgrade it into a Windows
		(yes, Windows-only) GUI tool because of all the
		random-ass GBA binary hacking tools that use
		this mid 00s aesthetic, and I miss it a bunch.
		It was kino. It was a Python tool, and for it
		all I rewrote it in Nim. Go figure. :p
	</p>
	<p>
		Major props, of course, go to Ward's
		<a href="https://github.com/khchen/wNim" target="_blank">wNim</a>
		library for making this possible. I don't really
		wanna deal with VB6 just to make this silly
		app, lmao.
	</p>
	<h2>Why use this?</h2>
	<p>
		For the simple reason that Furnace actually
		emulates a Game Boy, so what you hear is
		a lot closer to what you get.
	</p>
	<h2>Any catches?</h2>
	<p>A few, actually:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I haven't yet looked into the new v158+
			pattern format, and I don't wanna code in
			support for the old (&lt; v127) instrument
			format (esp. for a quick project),
			so the acceptable versions are
			<b>127&ndash;157</b>, which means only
			modules created <b>between 0.6pre2 and
			0.6pre4</b> work with this tool. Sorry. :(
		</li>
		<li>
			Because it is expressly for converting
			Furnace project files to the GBC Pok&eacute;mon
			disassemblies format, the project <b>must
			only consist of a single Game Boy chip.</b>
			Likewise, only Game Boy instruments are
			supported with this tool. Any wild FM instrument
			and it'll freak out...
		</li>
		<li>
			If, in a pattern, the first note does not
			start at row 0, you should put a
			rest (OFF) note <i>at</i> row 0.
		</li>
		<li>
			Looping is supported, but it's assumed
			that only one <code>0Bxx</code> effect is
			present in the entire project. If the song
			does not loop, do not include a <code>0Bxx</code> effect.
		</li>
		<li>
			Duty cycles are only serviced through the
			<code>12xx</code> effect.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stereo panning is supported through the
			<code>08xy</code> effect.
		</li>
		<li>
			Setting the wave instrument is supported
			through the
			<code>10xx</code> effect on channel 3.
		</li>
		<li>
			The noise channel works like this:
			Notes are ignored, but <i>instrument
			numbers</i> are important. The tool does
			not currently support mapping these
			instrument numbers to drum set numbers
			from the get-go, but constants will be
			made for you so you can edit them
			in.
		</li>
		<li>
			The song title is used for naming
			labels and constants. A song title like
			<code>Cinnabar island</code> will be
			transformed to <code>Music_CinnabarIsland</code>
			and <code>CINNABAR_ISLAND</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Macros are not supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have a <code>Bxx</code> or <code>Dxx</code>
			effect on one of the channels, you should have it
			on the rest of them, otherwise channels would
			desync.
		</li>
		<li>
			There may be some bugs I haven't yet accounted for.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Why is this an HTML page? Don't you think getting pwned through using IE is a concern?</h2>
	<p>
		Yeahhhh I was gonna use RTF, but I couldn't
		scroll vertically, so... :p
